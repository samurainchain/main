# Tiltless — Trading Journal (iOS)

Product name: Tiltless, domain tiltless.xyz (renamed from the working name Mirror). The Xcode project, targets, Swift types and browser storage keys (`mirror.settings`, IndexedDB `mirror`, backup format `mirror-backup`) keep the old name on purpose: renaming them would lose users' data or needs a Mac to verify.

Full product spec: docs/SPEC.md. Read the relevant section before every task.

## Stack
- Swift 6, SwiftUI, iOS 26+, Xcode 26
- SwiftData + CloudKit (private DB), Swift Charts, Vision, WidgetKit
- RevenueCat for subscriptions (entitlement: "pro")
- No third-party UI libraries, no Combine, no ad/tracking SDKs

## Architecture rules
- Feature folders under Features/, each with View + @Observable ViewModel
- Business logic only in Core/ services, injected via @Environment
- Views never compute stats and never call RevenueCat directly
- All money values are Decimal, never Double
- Each trade belongs to an Account with an AssetClass (cryptoSpot, cryptoPerp, stock, futures); entry form fields and PnL math depend on it (futures use contract multiplier, see SPEC section 6)
- SwiftData models: every property optional or defaulted, no unique constraints, optional relationships (CloudKit requirement)
- StatsEngine = pure functions, fully unit-tested with Swift Testing

## UI rules
- Use only DesignSystem tokens and components; no hardcoded colors, fonts or spacing
- Native iOS 26 components and gestures first (sheets, swipe actions, context menus, Liquid Glass navigation)
- Every user-facing string goes through Localizable.xcstrings (en, ru, es)
- Numbers use .monospacedDigit(); profit/loss always shows sign, not only color
- Support Dynamic Type and VoiceOver on every screen

## Paywall rules (App Store Guideline 3.1.2)
- Billed amount is the most prominent price element
- No free-trial toggle; trial belongs to the annual plan card
- Show trial length and post-trial price; Restore, Terms, Privacy always visible
- Prices come from RevenueCat Offerings, never hardcoded

## Workflow
- Work one stage of docs/SPEC.md section 11 at a time
- Before coding, write a short plan and list files you will touch
- After coding: build, run tests, fix all warnings
- Never delete or rename models without a migration plan
- Ask me before adding any dependency

## Web app (web/)
- React + TypeScript + Vite, deployed to GitHub Pages by .github/workflows/web.yml
- Same product rules as the iOS app: SPEC is the source of truth, money via big.js decimal strings (never floats), design tokens in src/design/tokens.css
- Data lives in the browser (IndexedDB) behind the JournalBackend interface; SyncingBackend records every write and CloudSync syncs with Supabase (last-write-wins per record, tombstones for deletes). Schema: web/supabase/schema.sql; project URL and anon key in src/app/cloudConfig.ts (never the service_role key)
- System mistake tags have fixed ids (`system-<key>`) so copies from different devices merge
- Per-trade math in src/core/pnl.ts, pure and unit-tested (Vitest)
- Every user-facing string goes through src/i18n/messages (en, ru, es); the ru/es catalogs are type-checked against en
- Screenshot reader: Tesseract.js runs in the browser with English and Russian models (src/features/entry/recognize.ts); text-to-fields parsing is pure and tested (src/core/ocr). Synthetic screenshots live in test-fixtures/ocr (regenerate with scripts/ocr-fixtures/generate.cjs); measure accuracy with scripts/ocr-fixtures/accuracy.cjs against a running preview. Never commit real exchange screenshots
- Legal pages: static English HTML in public/privacy/ and public/terms/ (styles in public/legal.css), linked from Profile and the onboarding welcome; they describe what the app really does with data, so update them when data flows change (new provider, analytics, payments)
- Accessibility: token contrast is unit-tested (WCAG AA); `npm run audit:a11y` checks every screen in a browser against a running preview (names, alt text, ids, headings, 200% text, focus)
- Before pushing: `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build` in web/
- Monetization: the web app is free for now (no paywall, no free-tier limits). Later Pro via Stripe, preferably RevenueCat Web Billing so the `pro` entitlement is shared with iOS; web prices slightly below iOS (SPEC section 8, "Веб-версия"). Stripe billing (web/supabase/functions/billing-*, src/app/billing.ts, ProSection) is built and was tested end to end in test mode; Profile hides it until `PRO_ON_SALE` in src/app/billing.ts is turned on with live keys and Terms/Privacy/Refund pages. Blocked for now (2026-10): the owner has Russian documents only, so Stripe (the current test account is registered in Mexico and needs an RFC), Paddle and Lemon Squeezy can't be activated; payments wait until the owner has a legal seller status in a supported country. Don't try to switch to live mode or suggest workarounds that misstate the seller's country
- Crypto payments (the current way to sell Pro, `PAYMENT_PROVIDER = 'crypto'`): NOWPayments invoices for a month or a year of Pro, no auto-renewal. Functions crypto-invoice (GET prices, POST invoice) and crypto-webhook (reads every payment back from the NOWPayments API before granting; the IPN signature is only logged); tables crypto_orders and pro_access, Pro extended once per order by the SQL function apply_crypto_order. Pure logic in supabase/functions/_shared/cryptoPayments.ts, tested in src/core/billing. `?pro=preview` shows the Pro section in one browser tab before it is on sale. Paused 2026-10-28 mid-test: the owner set NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY and NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_SECRET and ran the SQL; invoices open fine, but paying the $8.99 monthly pass in USDT TRC20 failed on NOWPayments' page with "amountTo is too small" (the payout wallet's coin or network likely differs, or the minimum is above $9). Resume by checking the payout wallet (USDT TRC20), then a real test payment; Free vs Pro, the 7-day trial and the Refund Policy are done (SPEC section 8, src/core/entitlements.ts, src/app/entitlement.tsx, public/refund/); the launch checklist, with the 30-day gift for existing users, is docs/pro-launch.md
- Partner program (SPEC section 8): 30% of a referred trader's Pro payments for 12 months, payable after 14 days, paid by hand in USDT (TRC20) monthly from $30. Tables partners, referrals, partner_commissions and functions become_partner, set_payout_wallet, claim_referral, partner_stats in web/supabase/schema.sql; commissions are written by apply_crypto_order. Browser side in src/app/referral.ts (link kept 60 days in `mirror.referral`), pure rules in src/core/referral.ts, page in src/features/partners. Owner's payout queries: docs/partners.md. Live: the owner ran docs/migrations/2026-10-28-partners.sql and 2026-10-28-pro-trial.sql on 2026-10-28 and saw the partner link appear

## Design direction
- Two styles the user picks (Profile, or the theme menu in the top bar): "glow" (default) and "flat". Flat is the Supabase-dashboard look: near-black background, thin 1px borders, small uppercase monospace labels, dense cards. Glow (src/design/glow.css, inspired by the Deadlock Mod Manager the owner likes) adds the accent's light: corner glows over a faint grid, translucent cards with a lit top edge, a filled glowing current tab, glowing primary buttons and hero numbers
- Five accents (emerald by default, amber, violet, blue, pink) in tokens.css, each with a dark and a light variant, all WCAG AA (contrast.test.ts covers every accent and theme). No red accent: red means loss. Profit and loss colors never change with the accent
- Further visual work should go through these tokens and styles, not one-off colors

## Instagram marketing
- Skills /ig-reel, /ig-viral, /ig-caption, /ig-carousel, /ig-story, /ig-profile, /ig-plan, /ig-human, /ig-comment, /ig-reply, /ig-dm, /ig-repurpose, /ig-audit live in .claude/skills/ig-* (third-party, MIT, copied unchanged; see .claude/skills/LICENSE-instagram-agent-skill)
- Their files live in the repo, not in ~/.claude/instagram (the cloud container is temporary): read and write marketing/instagram/voice.md, swipe.md, plan.md and log.md wherever a skill says ~/.claude/instagram/
- Nothing is posted without the owner's yes; no profit or income claims (Meta ad policy, SPEC)
